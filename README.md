## A short tutorial [KasperKain](https://github.com/KasperKain/PerScholas_Factories/commits?author=KasperKain) wrote to help explain factories in Object Oriented Programming.

The following steps were taken in this activity:
* Cloned the project to your computer and open it in VSCode.
* Read through factoryEx1.js and run it _(node factoryEx1.js)_
* Read through factoryEx2.js and run it _(node factoryEx2.js)_
* Altered class names, object names, attack shouts, and added methods.
